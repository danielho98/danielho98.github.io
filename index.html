			<p> I'm currently a researcher at the UC Berkeley HART (Hand-Assistive Robotics Technologies) Lab. We are a computer science and electronics-based research lab
				under the EECS department at Cal. Our focus this semester has involved tackling the processing of medical images with an automated approach. We are working with
				OpenCV in Python and using computer vision techniques to process images in a way that will save a significant number of man-hours, as the proecss is currently manual
				and a tedious process. We are also exploring the use of neural nets to solve other problems we are currently looking at. </p>

			<p> In high school during the summer of my senior year, I was a researcher in the Mullins Lab at University of Pennsylvania. Our primary field of study was developmental biology,
			where we used zebrafish as a model organism. My PI, Benjamin Tajer, focused on exploring the viability of chimeric receptors in the zebrafish. We tracked early stages of development
			in the gestation period of zebrafish, hoping to gain further insight in the development stages of humans. My work and wet lab skills involved HRM (high resolution melt) analysis, 
			western blot, Qiagen purification on large samples, DNA amplification, DNA genome analysis (post-sequencing) and more. The Mullins lab operates in one of the largest zebrafish facilities in the 
			country. </p>

			<p> Research has always been a point of interest for me outside of the classroom. There's usually a learning curve involved with research -- 
			becoming an expert in your topic of research and knowing how to execute research efficiently. Progress may not always be shown linearly,
			and this can get frustrating sometimes, but it's something I see as worthwhile and rewarding. </p>

			<p> I'm finishing my first year as a freshman at UC Berkeley. In the past, I've taken CS61a, a major requirement CS course taught in Python, Scheme, and SQL. I've previously audited
				Berkeley's Ruby on Rails Decal, an optional course that teaches Ruby on Rails specifically. Currently, I am enrolled in CS61b Data Structures, which is taught in Java. 
				I'm also taking CS198 Web Design Decal, which teaches front end programming and principles of design in HTML, CSS, and jQuery javascript. 
			<p> I find that my coursework, much like many other things I spend my time on, reflect what I'm interested in. My interest in web development was part of the driving reason why 
				I took additional computer science courses in my freshman year, and I hope to find more experience in industry using my knowledge from class.</p>

			<p>BearMaps is a project similar to Google maps. It can take in latitude and longitude coordinates as an input and it will output an appropriate map of Berkeley scaled to the 
			proper resolution and size. For it's direction functionality, the program creates a graph out of all the streets and locations in Berkeley, and uses A* algorithm (a directed version of Dijkstra's algorithm) to 
			find the shortest path to the destination. It also has a search function that utilizes the Trie data structure to output all possible results given a search query. </p>
			<p>Gl0w is an arduino-based hackathon project that I created last year. It features a temperature sensor and an RGB LED that displays different colors depending on the temperature 
				read on the sensor. The picture seen here on this website is a picture of this project.</p>
			<p>Earlier this year, I started working with Jacob Alexander on his project KLL, the Keyboard Layout Language. It's a custom firmware project for keyboards that aims
				to create a universal firmware platform for keyboards. You can find the code for this project here: https://github.com/kiibohd/kll </p>

			<p>There's an almost cult-like following of people interested in computer keyboards as a hobby, and I am one of them!</p>
			<p>I've lost count of the number of keyboards I own, but I know that I own at least 30 keyboards currently, and I estimate the current value 
				of my collection to be worth over $5000! (that's more than what my car is worth)</p> 
			<p>The amount of keyboard enthusiasts has grown to be very large in recent years. It consists of a tight-knit community of people
				who are interested in a niche product, but the appeal has expanded widely. In high school, I wrote full-length product reviews of new keyboards
				and posted these reviews online, gathering thousands of views for each review. I also worked with employees at Massdrop, a once-startup company in San Francisco
				that sold enthusiast-grade items including keyboards. </p>
			<p>Earlier this year, I worked with Jacob Alexander to organize a meetup for keyboard enthusiasts. We hosted the event at Facebook HQ and there were over 100 attendees at
				the meetup, and featured food, cool prizes and free t-shirts for those who came. </p>
			<p>I was also recently interviewed by a man working on writing a book detailing the entire history of keyboards, and he asked me about the keyboards in the modern era and 
				about keyboards as a hobby for many people today. </p>

			<p>The stereotypes of UC Berkeley students are true! We really are hard workers, and I make the most of the downtime that I get.</p>
			<p>Here lies a shoutout to all my friends, I appreciate the friendships that I have so much and I savor the time that I get to spend with my closest friends.</p>
			<p>Cycling is great fun, it's a grueling endurance sport that's exhilirating at the same time. I'm a competitve road cyclist and a member of the UC Berkely cycling team, and recently scored
				a podium position at conference championships this year! I also road my bike from my house in the Bay Area to Los Angeles last year. I used to be a member of the varsity tennis team
				in high school, and I currently run with Strawberry Canyon Track Club at Berkeley. </p>
			<p>When I'm not outside enjoying California weather, you might find me practicing Super Smash Brothers Melee in one of the garages of my friends. I show up to tournaments once in a while to 
				duke it out with local players, and I enjoy the thriving competitive eSports scene in the game. </p>
			<p>I am also a photographer! I've been taking pictures since my freshman year of high school and I'm a past AP Studio Art 2D photography student. If you find me in the middle of the woods
			on my mountain bike with a camera slung behind my back, be sure to call my name! </p>
